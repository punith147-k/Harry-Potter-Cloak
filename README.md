# Harry-Potter-Cloak
This project implements the Invisible Cloak Effect using OpenCV and Python, inspired by Harry Potter's invisibility cloak. The program dynamically detects the cloth color at runtime, captures the background, and replaces the cloak region with the background in real-time, creating a disappearing effect.
